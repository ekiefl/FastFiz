# Why?

FastFiz, the successor of PoolFiz, was a historical software used for competing autonomous 8-ball agents against one another in a series of computational pool tournaments, the Computational Pool Olympiad. These tournaments invigorated a lot of research into the game theory of pool. As the mantainer of a more modern pool/billiards simulation tool, [pooltool](https://github.com/ekiefl/pooltool), I was interested in a comparison.

The problem was that I couldn't find the code anywhere! It was once hosted by the Stanford Billiards Group at http://www.stanford.edu/group/billiards, however Stanford doesn't host that site anymore. Using the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) I found [this little nugget](https://web.archive.org/web/20100621120417/http://www.stanford.edu/group/billiards/software.html) of history, where I found an archive of `FastFiz-0.2`. That's the directory you see right here in this repo.

Enjoy!
